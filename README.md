# COMP-1633-F23-Cplusplus-Notes



## Coding Standards 

### :white_check_mark: GOOD 
* white space for increased readability
* one statement per line 
* consistent bracing formats with paired open and close braces aligned vertically
* variable and function names, must be meaningful and self-descriptive, with underscores to separate words:
    * function names start with verb, lowercase e.g. get_name
    * variable names describe what it is, lowercase e.g. avg_grade 
    * constants are capitalized e.g. TAX_RATE
* A function must have a single exit point (i.e. return statement), at the end of the
function body, at most one return statement for each function.
* One function, one job. 
* Keep calculations separate from output and return statements. Use variables to store intermediate calcs.
* Each variable should have exactly one purpose. 
* All local variable declarations at the top of each function, before the statements.
* length of any line is to be less than or equal to **80 characters**. Should be shorter than this line:
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Opening documentation:
```
1. your name.
2. your MRU email address.
3. your course/section number.
4. instructorâ€™s name, the assignment number.
5. source file name and the submission date. 
```

Header documentation for each function must include the following:
```
1. Function name.
2. Purpose, what the function does.
3. Details of function.
4. Input, type of data, and example input.
5. Output, type of data and desired result.
```

### :x: AVOID
* Global variables are unacceptable. **Global constants are encouraged** e.g. GST used in several functions.
