Notes on C++


// In this course, global variables are not allowed. Constants (using const) may be declared globally or locally. Global constants
are encouraged e.g. GST used in several functions.

allowed!)

–
returns a single result
OR
–
returns nothing (void)

double calc_open_balance(){}

Variable:
open_balance =
